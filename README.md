# Yan85 Angr Lifter Base.
This project serves as a structure for integrating the Yan85 architecture with the powerful angr analysis platform. Leveraging my implementation, I successfully lifted the custom 8-bit Yan85 architecture to pyvex, enabling advanced symbolic and concolic execution within angr.

I have chosen to keep the full project—encompassing comprehensive definitions for functions, syscalls, flags, and more—private, my primary goal is to encourage other students to develop their own implementations using angr, which can be a hard-to-approach framework.

Given that angr's steep learning curve can be daunting, this repository provides a structured example to guide you in organizing your own project.

I would highly recommend the following additional resources:
